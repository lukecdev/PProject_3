## UX
### Strategy
The objective of the site is for users to test their word guessing ablity. 
#### Scope
- Ask the user for their user name.
- Ask the user to chose to enter game or read game instructions.
- Offer the user 2 levels of game difficulty - Easy or Expert.
- Allow the user to guess the word in the given lives.

#### User Stories
I want a game that is simple to play from the start.
I want the game to provide a challenge for differnt users.
I want instructions for the game to be simple to understand.


## Design

- As this game is devloped in a Python terminal. There is not many design options. Readability and usablity are most important. 
### Colour

- To add some colour to the text in the terminal by intalling Colorama in Python. This allows for the Green and Yellow colurs to the text.

### Flow Chart

During the planning process a flow chart was created to show the basic steps needed to play the game.


## Features

1. Welcome Screen 
    - This is the first screen when the program runs. It asks for the user to enter a name to continue.

    - The game displays the user with two difficulty levels for the game. Selecting a level affects how many lives the user gets to guess the secret word.
    - Easy level gives the user 10 lives.
    - Expert level gives the user 5 lives.

### Future Features

- Word topics. Adding a section to select what topic of words to guess.
- Graphics would help improve the appeal of the game.
- The ability for the user to enter the full word if they know it. 

## Technologies Used
1. Python - All code was written in Python language
2. Github - For code repository and code version control.
3. Heroku - To deploy the live application.
4. Gitpod - Cload based code editor used.
5. LucidCharts - Used for flow chart creation.
6. Colored - Was used to add color to terminal text.

## Deployment

The project was deployed using Code Institutes mock terminal for Heroku.

### Deployment

Include instructions here on how to deploy your project. For your first project you will most likely be using GitHub Pages.

### Local Development

The local development section gives instructions on how someone else could make a copy of your project to play with on their local machine. This section will get more complex in the later projects, and can be a great reference to yourself if you forget how to do this.

#### Forking the repository
1. Log into the Github repository.
2. Underneath your avatar is a button labelled **Fork**, click this.
3. You should have your own copy now..

#### Cloning the repository
1. Log into Github and locate the repository.
2. Under the repository name click the button labelled **code**.
3. You will see an option to clone or download.
4. Copy the url for cloning by clicking the clipboard icon.
5. Launch Codeanywhere or your own choice of directory.
6. Change the current working directory to the location you want the cloned directory to be.
7. Type git clone and paste the Url from step 4. 
8. Press enter to create the cloned directory.

A huge thanks to [Chris Quinn](https://github.com/10xOXR) for his help, suggestions and patiece while I put together this project. 



## Creating the Heroku app

When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:

1. `heroku/python`
2. `heroku/nodejs`
